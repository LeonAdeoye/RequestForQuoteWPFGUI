RequestForQuoteWPFGUI
=====================

RequestForQuote WPF GUI client.

Client written using C# 4.5 and WPF.

Communicates with Java back-end using web services, and an asynchronous socket mechanism.

Uses MVVM and the PRISM framework for separation of concerns; highly modularized.

NUNIT for automated unit testing, Moq for mocking, Jenkins for CI.

Client comprises of RFQ search & filtering tools, chat mechanism, option pricing, static data maintenance, central grid displaying RFQs, graphical charting.

Covers just option spreads right now but I plan to expand first to swaps, and then to generic derivative products.

Apologies, still plenty of work to be done...I try to add a little each day to reduce my debt.
